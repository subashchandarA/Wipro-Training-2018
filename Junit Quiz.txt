1) JUnit is a used by testing team to perform integration testing.

2) we can have multiple test methods in a test case

3) we can test multiple methods in  a test method.

4) A test method can only have one assert statement.

5) Junit test passes if atleast one test method gets passed.
6) Consider the method given below:
	public class Employee {
	public String getEmployeeName() {
	String name="Sophia";
	return name;
	}
	 }
   Let us test this method with the following:
	@Test
	public void testEmployeeName() {
	String resultName="Sophia";
	assertSame("Unable to get expected name" , 	resultName, new Employee().getEmployeeName	());
	}

7) Lets say I have a method that returns an array of    Student objects as shown below:
	public Student[] getStudArray(){}
	{ Student[] s = new Student[2];
		s[0]= new Student(101, "Sureka");
		s[1]= new Student(102,"Suresh");
}

Let us say I have a test method as follows:

	@Test
	public void testStudentArray(){
	Student[] s1 = new Student[2];
		s1[0]= new Student(101, "Sureka");
		s1[1]= new Student(102,"Suresh");
	assertArrayEquals(s1, new TestStudent	().getStudArray())
	}
 Is assertArrayEquals going to return true?

8) can we change access specfier for test methods? 
9) can we add arguments in test methods?
10) fail() method fails the test case even when all      other test methods pass.
11) @Ignore fails the test method.
12) test methods annotated with @BeforeClass and @AfterClass should be static
